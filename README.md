# 🛡️ Cyber Threat Detection Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview

Cybersecurity threats are becoming increasingly complex and frequent, posing significant risks to organizations around the world. These threats include:

- Malware
- Phishing attacks
- Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks

Traditional detection methods often fall short in recognizing evolving attack vectors. This project leverages the power of **deep learning** to analyze system activity logs and detect malicious behavior with high accuracy and speed.

---

## 🤖 Project Objective

Design and implement a **deep learning model** capable of detecting suspicious activities within system logs. The goal is to help cybersecurity analysts **proactively identify** and mitigate threats using advanced machine learning techniques.

---

## 📊 Dataset: BETH

The model is trained and evaluated on the **BETH dataset**, which simulates real-world system logs. Each row in the dataset represents an event generated by a process or thread, with various attributes and a binary label indicating whether the event is **suspicious (`1`)** or **benign (`0`)**.

### 📁 Features Description

| Column Name       | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `processId`       | Unique identifier for the process that generated the event (`int64`) |
| `threadId`        | ID for the thread spawning the log (`int64`) |
| `parentProcessId` | ID of the parent process (`int64`) |
| `userId`          | ID of the user spawning the log |
| `mountNamespace`  | Mounting namespace used by the process (`int64`) |
| `argsNum`         | Number of arguments passed to the event (`int64`) |
| `returnValue`     | Return value from the event (usually 0) (`int64`) |
| `sus_label`       | Target label indicating if the event is malicious (`1`) or not (`0`) |

📝 **Note**: The dataset has already undergone preprocessing.
